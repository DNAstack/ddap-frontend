    Headings are role names (qualified by view). Checkboxes represent the expected access of each test persona on a view.
    A box is checked if and only if the labelled persona is expected to have access.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a box is red, the changes you are making have altered the expected state. Please either modify your changes
    to maintain the expected state, or click the checkbox to explicitly change the expected access.
